### User Story
```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
## Installation:

Utilizing the Application is simple!

Option A - Use the GitHub Pages Deployment directly by way of https://jmabie94.github.io/react-portfolio-v2/.

Option B - Clone the repo:
    
    git clone git@github.com:jmabie94/react-portfolio-v2.git

Next, open an integrated terminal in your cloned folder and do the following:
    
    run "npm init -y"
    run "npm i"

After Node Packages have installed, open run the application:

    run "npm run start"


Finally, the application should open automatically in your browser!

CAREER COACH NOTES - WORKING LIST

4.  Maybe add blog?

5.  For Project 2 / Disc Exchange fork the repository and rename so that it's not just /Project-2 and can actually show /DiscExchange or something along those lines - also add descriptions! (Probably best to do this as well for LazyLoaderMealGenerator) - also remove "Group 7" from Game Room App

6.  Do a proper README for the new React Portfolio

7.  LazyLoader README could use styling adjustment to be more consistent with the other Projects

8.  Use LinkedIn headline and primary languages in the GitHub bio section so it's not just name and @. Corey sent this: "Full Stack Developer | Javascript | SQL | ReactJS"

9.  Add websites to Linkedin Contact section (Portfolio!) Also, consider simplifying first line on the LinkedIn bio so that it focuses in on the Web Dev stuff.

10. Add Bootcamp Certificate as Media in the FEATURED section of LinkedIn, and add all of the coding projects in the FEATURED section as links, highlighting them on the page earlier. Add some additional coding stuff to the SKILLS section including APIs and the back-end stuff that was omitted, then reorder to highlight the top skills I have.

11. Go through the LinkedIn networks of companies, filter for closest regions, filter for software engineers and take a look through (and potentially reach out to) profiles to see what it takes to work at such company or what I could do to get qualified for better consideration. -->
